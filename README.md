# makefilez

A collection of helpful makefiles for projects.

So far I've built what I found useful for some personal and professional products.

## Why?

Every time I created a new project I found myself recreating Makefile with largely the same targets.

## Why make?

- Widely available
- Easy to add new targets/features
- Didn't require building a wrapper CLI

## Available makefiles

- [docker](./modules/docker/Makefile)
- [docker compose](./modules/compose/Makefile)
- [git](./modules/git/Makefile)
- [project](./modules/project/Makefile)
- [python](./modules/python/Makefile)

## Contributing

If you would like to add more features and functionality, please create an issue requesting new functionality first to ensure that similar work is not already being done. After that, please feel free to submit PRs!
